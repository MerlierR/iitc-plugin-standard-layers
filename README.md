# IITC Plugin - Standard Layer

Adds highlighters for the stock intel layers
* Visited: highlight visited portals
* Visited (inverse): highlight portals that are not yet visited
* Captured: highlight captured portals
* Captured (inverse): highlight portals that are not yet captured
* Scout Controlled: highlight scout controlled portals
* Scout Controlled (inverse): highlight portals that are not scout controlled

# Known limitations

* The layer data is only provided when the zoom is set to show all portals. Nothing will be highlighted if the zoom is too high.
* While refreshing the map, some portals could be highlighted as not visited/captured/scout controlled.
